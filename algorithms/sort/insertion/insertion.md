### INSERTION SORT ###
---------------------------

Insertion sort is an in-place memory swap sorting algorithm that runs in _o_(n^2) time. Insertion sort is similar to how one would sort a deck of cards. You pick on element and search for its proper place in the list.


|           | Worst    | Best   | Average  | Worst-Space |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Insertion | _O_(n^2) | _O_(n) | _O_(n^2) | _O_(n)      |

_Ex:_ sorting this list `6 5 3 1 8 7 2 4`

```
    v
    6 5 3 1 8 7 2 4  // first we look at 6 and find its place in the list
    
```
