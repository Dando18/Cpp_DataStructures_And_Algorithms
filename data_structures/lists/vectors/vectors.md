### VECTORS ###
---------------

Vectors are an ordered data structure containing a linear arrangement of objects or primitives. Vectors are
different from arrays in that they allow for new data to be added.

| | Insert | Get | 
| - | - | - |
| **worst** | _O_(n) | _O_(1) |
| **best**  |        |     |
| **avg**   |        |     |


``` c++
    template <typename T>
    class vector {
        
    };
```
